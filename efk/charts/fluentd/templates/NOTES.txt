To verify that Fluentd Elasticsearch has started, run:

  kubectl --namespace={{ .Release.Namespace }} get all -l "app={{ template "fluentd.name" . }},release={{ .Release.Name }}"

THIS APPLICATION CAPTURES ALL CONSOLE OUTPUT AND FORWARDS IT TO Elasticsearch. Anything that might be identifying,
including things like IP addresses, container images, and object names will NOT be anonymized.


# Limitation
Caution, file buffer implementation depends on the characteristics of local file system. Donâ€™t use file buffer on remote file system, e.g. NFS, GlusterFS, HDFS and etc. We observed major data loss by using remote file system.
